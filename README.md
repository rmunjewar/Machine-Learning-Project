# Machine-Learning-Project

Professional tennis match outcomes hinge on various factors, from player skill and stamina to external conditions like court surface and tournament level. Traditional prediction models struggle with accuracy due to the complexity of performance metrics. With the rise of sports analytics and betting, machine learning offers a promising alternative for improving predictive accuracy.

Our approach to predicting tennis match outcomes will utilize supervised machine-learning techniques applied to historical tennis match data. 

For this project, we will use the Jeff Sackmann Tennis Database, which contains comprehensive match-level data for ATP (menâ€™s) professional tennis matches dating back to 1968. This dataset is available on GitHub at https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp for ATP matches.
